# Delta Theme Website
> Website for a client. 

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install gulp globally
npm i -g gulp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run gulp by typing
npm start

# This will create dist folder. Inside a folder you will find minified html, css and js files. 
# Inside dist folder you will also find img folder where all compressed images will be stored.
# File server.js in a root folder starts server on localhost:3000.
# Once you run gulp, gulp will connect to server.js file and start the server.
# Gulp also comes with gulp watch and live-reload.

# Once you are done testing make sure to delete dist folder by running
gulp clean
``` 

## App Info

Website is a remake of an actual Delta Theme layout made with my own touch. Work in progress.
