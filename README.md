# Delta Theme Website
> Website for a client.

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Tell gulp to watch for changes 
gulp watch

# Previous command also starts server at localhost:3080  and creates minified files that will be stored in:
resources/dist
``` 

## App Info

Website is a remake of an actual Delta Theme layout made with my own touch.
